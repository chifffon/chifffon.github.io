    It seems like I'm actually scared of being with other people. I show myself
    as closed, dull and inexpressive when I'm with others, like I am caged and
    mechanic. My therapist says that this is a habit that I picked up
    interacting with my brother when I was younger. I was rejected by him, and
    was taught to reject myself as well.
