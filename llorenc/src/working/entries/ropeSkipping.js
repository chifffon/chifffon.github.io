    I was trying to get better at rope skipping, specifically doing double
    unders. My target was to see how close I could get to the 30-second world
    record for double unders. From my attempts, I was able to do 71, although I
    reported doing 78 one time. This is something hard to track because I need
    to be very focused on doing the double unders as fast as possible while
    counting. I believe I reported 78 one time but based on my other reports I
    believe my max was 70 or 71 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

    [Oct 5 2020] Did 65 double jumps at the end of my rope skipping workout
    today. In 30 secs. My PR was ~71?

    [Oct 12 2020] 70

    [Oct 13 2020] 60, more endurance work overall.

    [Oct 21 2020] 78?? Seems too much, I don't even know if I'm counting
    correctly.

    [Nov 25 2020] Entirely stopped! The air is too cold and I can't rope skip in
    my apartment building, it would drive my neighbors crazy, I've decided to
    stop doing this for a while, even though it was a load of fun! I will be
    replacing this activity with running.
