    This is an ongoing effort. I believe I am handicapped in terms of being
    social. I can't seem to make myself not look depressed, no matter how hard I
    try. I consciously try to smile, be welcoming and interesting, and I can get
    to fake it for a while, but no matter the effort, eventually my genuine
    depressed-self manifests.
    {space} Lately I think I feel like not trying anymore, and just embrace my
    gloom, it has been so long that I've tried to be different. Can people
    change fundamentally? This is a conversation I've had several times with my
    therapist and I really haven't taken any concrete steps to solve this. How
    does someone become better at socializing while there are so many things
    happening in life? I keep finding ways to avoid this. - Oct 22
