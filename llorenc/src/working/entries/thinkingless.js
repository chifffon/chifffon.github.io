    I've actually found myself struggling a little bit writing the very first
    "entry" on my website, due to the conflict of being identified on the
    internet and being entirely geniune; my thoughts might come off as
    pessimistic and/or troubled, and there are people that could(?) read what
    I'm writing. Being judged is one of of the things that genuinely scare me.
    Thinking about it right now, I guess I am not entirely sure of how to accept
    who I am in an integral level: what do I do for work, what are the things
    that go through my mind, and how do I interact with people, thinking more
    about it this just seems that I'm working to keep myself off in the shade,
    without ever trying to accept who I am as a whole. For now my objective is
    to expose myself a little bit more, and this is just a medium to reach that.
    Perhaps it would help me to hide a little bit of what I do for work, not
    because I am ashamed of it, in fact I pretty proud to be working for such a
    great changing and positive cause, but because I want to have a certain
    degree of anonimity and expressive freedom in here. {space}This entry was
    not supposed to be about what I wrote above, but I gave myself the freedom
    to use this bullet, which is of a topic that I like, to be where I wrote my
    first entry.
