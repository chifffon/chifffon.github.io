    I've actually found myself struggling a little bit writing the very first
    "entry" on my website, due to the conflict of being identified on the
    internet and being entirely geniune; my thoughts might come off as
    pessimistic and/or troubled, and there are people that could(?) read what
    I'm writing. Being judged is one of of the things that genuinely scare me.
    Thinking about it right now, I guess I am not entirely sure of how to accept
    who I am in an integral level: what do I do for work, what are the things
    that go through my mind, and how do I interact with people, thinking more
    about it this just seems that I'm working to keep myself off in the shade,
    without ever trying to accept who I am as a whole. For now my objective is
    to expose myself a little bit more, and this is just a medium to reach that.
    Perhaps it would help me to hide a little bit of what I do for work, not
    because I am ashamed of it, in fact I pretty proud to be working for such a
    great changing and positive cause, but because I want to have a certain
    degree of anonimity and expressive freedom in here. {space}This entry was
    not supposed to be about what I wrote above, but I gave myself the freedom
    to use this bullet, which is of a topic that I like, to be where I wrote my
    first entry.

    I've thought a bit about not thinking so much about deep unsolvable problems
    in my life that truly consume me, throughout my life I've thought that the
    correct thing to do is to disseminate and examine thoroughly the problem and
    keep answering section by section the things that trouble me about it, until
    I can get to a point where I can find either a way to solve it, or an
    explanation of what's wrong with me, or how I managed this problem poorly so
    that it brought me some kind of uneasiness in a considerable amount. What
    I've found is that there are certain issues where I have very small control,
    and me, being a person who chooses by choice a clear and predictable path,
    am overwhelmed by the amount of possibilities that I cannot predict and/or
    control, this is not something I avoid of relationships and situations, in
    fact, I look for these, but somehow, every time, I find myself in an
    uncomfortable state of being, where I often regret having gone through them.
    In retrospective, a lot of these situations have multiple outcomes that are
    possible, even if remotely, but this becomes overwhelming and becomes a
    hydra that once I try to understand a question and chop the snake's head off
    another two questions grow from it and then I try to examine one of these
    new questions and cut it off and another two grow from it and so on...
    becoming a never-ending entanglement of overwhelming, uncontrollable doubts
    inside my head. This is the first time I've thought of avoiding thinking
    about solving a problem deliberately - and tried, in my 27 years.
    {space} Sometimes it works! Sometimes it doesn't. I guess it works better
    for people that aren't hypervigilant.
