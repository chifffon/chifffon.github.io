    I had the fear of "petrifying", this fear first appeared in the time when I
    was working in my first job. I was probably 23 at the time and I started
    drinking coffee daily. It was my first engineering job and I got into it
    because I thought my two other "friends" at college were significantly
    smarter because they were working while studying, so I went to this
    interview - where they didn't even make me a technical assessment and they
    hired me on the spot, they probably asked me what was inheritance and
    polymorfism.

    The office was really small, there were three other engineers in there, they
    were significantly smarter than me. Even since that first job I always felt
    like an impostor, I didn't really work, I stayed quiet and tried to be nice
    and tried to work, but I really couldn't do much; my teammates took most of
    the work and it was a routine where I would pretend to do stuff and be
    productive, eventually I started studying to get a better job, at work, I
    started using l-theanine and caffeine to "perform better" and I couldn't
    handle it. These were the first times in my life where I genuinely believed
    that I could lose my mind, I had panic attacks at night, I thought I would
    stop speaking, that I would lose all willingness to open my mouth any longer
    and the moment would come where I would just shut it for the last time, and
    after that, I would stop moving, I would lose all willingness to move my
    arms, then my neck and head, eventually I would want to pee and I would do
    it where I layed, probably in my bed, then I would fall asleep, looking
    upwards, maybe I would have a seizure and that would pull me out of it, like
    it has done in the past.

    One of those days I had a discussion with my brother, I cried and told my
    father I really didn't want to keep living any longer, it is the only time
    that I have ever told him that, he hugged me while I cried, and he said he
    would talk with my brother because he was being irrational. My brother was
    often irrational, he took his own life three years later.
