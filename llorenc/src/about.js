          hi, lately I don't think I should be speaking or writing so much about
          myself, so I will try to keep my summary brief, even so - this is the
          default content that is picked from the homepage. maybe in the future
          I will have the creativity to have something more interesting for my
          homepage
        </h4>
        <p>
          I like people, but I am naturally shy and withdrawn. I am a tough
          person with myself. I need to constantly remind myself to not be
          hypervigilant.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I've struggled socially, but I am in a better mental position now. I
          am trying to talk more with people. I am trying to not be
          hypervigilant on myself. I am trying to not judge myself too harshly.
          I am trying to have fun. Someone I met said she was ok with being
          socially inadequate forever. Remarkably flawed.
        </p>
