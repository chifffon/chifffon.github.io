          lately I don't think I should be speaking or writing so much about
          myself, so I will try to keep my summary brief.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I am born mexican, with mostly indigenous and european ancestry, like
          most mexicans. I was raised in a middle/lower-middle class but I was
          able to go to private schools in Mexico - which is not uncommon for
          middle-class.<br></br> I have a bachelor's degree on Computer Science,
          and tried to study Nanotechnology Engineering and Physics before that.
          I lived with my parents for all of my life, until I moved to Seattle
          and got a job as a Software Engineer on January of 2020.
          <br></br>I want to get better at building connections and expressing
          myself. This is my main objective: to expose myself, and be
          comfortable exposing myself (and to create things). I go to therapy
          for psychoanalysis, and I go to another therapist for CBT, I am
          anxious and fidgety so I struggle to sit down and read/write. I enjoy
          music, I am generally pessimistic. I have good eye/hand coordination,
          so I'm a naturally fast learner in things where such prowess is
          required.
