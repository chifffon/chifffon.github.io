          hi, lately I don't think I should be speaking or writing so much about
          myself, so I will try to keep my summary brief
        </h4>
        <p>
          I've struggled socially, but I am in a better mental position now. I
          am trying to talk more with people. I am trying to not be
          hypervigilant on myself. I am trying to not judge myself too harshly.
          I am trying to have fun.
        </p>
      </div>
