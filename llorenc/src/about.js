          I think writing or talking about myself might be something risky for
          the reader, (I'll put the link here about why I think that); I don't
          want to convince the reader to like me or "take my side" by explaining
          myself so deeply. With that said, I will try to explain my reasoning
          and thoughts as clearly and genuinely as I can.

          <h3>Background</h3>I am born mexican, with mostly indigenous and
          european ancestry, like most mexicans. I was raised in a middle-class
          family and I was able to get private education in Mexico - which is
          not uncommon for middle-class families. My parents were raised in
          rural areas where education was not very accessible, eventually they
          moved cities and I grew up in the city of Guadalajara with two older
          brothers and my family, we had no other familiars in there, our aunts,
          cousins, etc. always lived in other cities, we had mostly a lonely
          childhood, surrounded by videogames and music, reading and writing was
          never part of my upbringing. We grew up into not-very-social kids.
          <br></br>
          <h3>Career stuff?</h3>I have a bachelor's degree on Computer Science,
          before that I tried to study Nanotechnology Engineering but dropped
          out, and then I tried Physics and dropped out as well. I lived with my
          parents for all of my life until I moved to Seattle and got a job as a
          Software Engineer on January of 2020. I'm very into what I'm working
          on right now, I think the engineering part is something that doesn't
          motivate me so much as what the product that we're building actually
          does for me, I honestly can't wait to see it empower people and change
          society for good, I have good hopes and genuine confidence in the
          people who are driving our team's work, but I'm not going to talk
          about it, at least not for now.
          <h3>What am I focusing on</h3>I want to get better at building
          connections and expressing myself. That is my main objective right
          now, to expose myself and to be comfortable doing so. <br></br> I go
          to therapy for psychoanalysis, and I go to another therapist for CBT,
          I am anxious and fidgety so I struggle to sit down and read/write. I
          enjoy music, I am generally pessimistic. I have good eye/hand
          coordination, so I'm a naturally fast learner in things where such
          prowess is required. But being entirely honest I am not great at
          following up with plans around becoming better socially or stepping
          out of my comfort zone in this regard, I am very fearful, and I have a
          big ego, with fragile expectations, I'll probably elaborate more of
          how my ego has developed, and how it manifests, in other sections of
          the site.
