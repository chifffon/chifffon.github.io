All Happy Companies Are Different</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 25 &middot; Location 304</div><div class='noteText'>Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines . Actually , capitalism and competition are opposites . Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital , but under perfect competition all profits get competed away . The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear : if you want to create and capture lasting value , don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 30 &middot; Location 352</div><div class='noteText'>Creative industries work this way , too . No screenwriter wants to admit that her new movie script simply rehashes what has already been done before .</h3>

If you’re less sensitive to social cues , you’re less likely to do the same things as everyone else around you . If you’re interested in making things or programming computers , you’ll be less afraid to pursue those activities single - mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 41 &middot; Location 493</div><div class='noteText'>Then when you apply your skills , you’re a little less likely than others to give up your own convictions : this can save you from getting caught up in crowds competing for obvious prizes .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 48 &middot; Location 595</div><div class='noteText'>As a good rule of thumb , proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage . Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell , especially in an already crowded market .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 48 &middot; Location 597</div><div class='noteText'>The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 60 &middot; Location 768</div><div class='noteText'>A definite view , by contrast , favors firm convictions . Instead of pursuing many - sided mediocrity and calling it “ well - roundedness , ” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 61 &middot; Location 770</div><div class='noteText'>Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable , she strives to be great at something substantive — to be a monopoly of one . This is not what young people do today , because everyone around them has long since lost faith in a definite world .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 62 &middot; Location 780</div><div class='noteText'>Today the whole Eurozone is in slow - motion crisis , and nobody is in charge . The European Central Bank doesn’t stand for anything but improvisation : the U.S . Treasury prints “ In God We Trust ” on the dollar ; the ECB might as well print “ Kick the Can Down the Road ” on the euro . Europeans just react to events as they happen and hope things don’t get worse . The indefinite pessimist can’t know whether the inevitable decline will be fast or slow , catastrophic or gradual . All he can do is wait for it to happen , so he might as well eat , drink , and be merry in the meantime : hence Europe’s famous vacation mania .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 63 &middot; Location 794</div><div class='noteText'>This is why the Chinese leadership is obsessed with the way in which things threaten to get worse .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 63 &middot; Location 795</div><div class='noteText'>not an abstraction . The Chinese public , too , knows that winter is coming . Outsiders are fascinated by the great fortunes being made inside China , but they pay less attention to the wealthy Chinese trying hard to get their money out of the country . Poorer Chinese just save everything they can and hope it will be enough . Every class of people in China takes the future deadly seriously .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 66 &middot; Location 841</div><div class='noteText'>The strange history of the Baby Boom produced a generation of indefinite optimists so used to effortless progress that they feel entitled to it .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 66 &middot; Location 843</div><div class='noteText'>Technological advance seemed to accelerate automatically , so the Boomers grew up with great expectations but few specific plans for how to fulfill them . Then , when technological progress stalled in the 1970s , increasing income inequality came to the rescue of the most elite Boomers . Every year of adulthood continued to get automatically better and better for the rich and successful . The rest of their generation was left behind , but the wealthy Boomers who shape public opinion today see little reason to question their naïve optimism . Since tracked careers worked for them , they can’t imagine that they won’t work for their kids , too .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 68 &middot; Location 859</div><div class='noteText'>Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it’s the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_pink'>pink</span>) - Page 68 &middot; Location 864</div><div class='noteText'>The indefiniteness of finance can be bizarre . Think about what happens when successful entrepreneurs sell their company . What do they do with the money ? In a financialized world , it unfolds like this : • The founders don’t know what to do with it , so they give it to a large bank . • The bankers don’t know what to do with it , so they diversify by spreading it across a portfolio of institutional investors . • Institutional investors don’t know what to do with their managed capital , so they diversify by amassing a portfolio of stocks . • Companies try to increase their share price by generating free cash flows . If they do , they issue dividends or buy back shares and the cycle repeats . At no point does anyone in the chain know what to do with money in the real economy . But in an indefinite world , people actually prefer unlimited optionality ; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it . Only in a definite future is money a means to an end , not the end itself .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 69 &middot; Location 884</div><div class='noteText'>It’s no surprise that entitlement spending has eclipsed discretionary spending every year since 1975 .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 71 &middot; Location 908</div><div class='noteText'>In philosophy , politics , and business , too , arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better future .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 76 &middot; Location 967</div><div class='noteText'>iteration without a bold plan won’t take you from 0 to 1 . A company is the strangest place of all for an indefinite optimist : why should you expect your own business to succeed without a plan to make it happen ? Darwinism may be a fine theory in other contexts , but in startups , intelligent design works best .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 78 &middot; Location 989</div><div class='noteText'>A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 78 &middot; Location 991</div><div class='noteText'>YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 78 &middot; Location 998</div><div class='noteText'>begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance . You are not a lottery ticket .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>7. Follow the Money</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 90 &middot; Location 1101</div><div class='noteText'>You should focus relentlessly on something you’re good at doing , but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>8. Secrets</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 92 &middot; Location 1122</div><div class='noteText'>Remember our contrarian question : what important truth do very few people agree with you on ? If we already understand as much of the natural world as we ever will — if all of today’s conventional ideas are already enlightened , and if everything has already been done — then there are no good answers . Contrarian thinking doesn’t make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 93 &middot; Location 1131</div><div class='noteText'>what valuable company is nobody building ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 96 &middot; Location 1170</div><div class='noteText'>First is incrementalism . From an early age , we are taught that the right way to do things is to proceed one very small step at a time ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 96 &middot; Location 1174</div><div class='noteText'>Second is risk aversion . People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong . By definition , a secret hasn’t been vetted by the mainstream . If your goal is to never make a mistake in your life , you shouldn’t look for secrets . The prospect of being lonely but right — dedicating your life to something that no one else believes</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 97 &middot; Location 1177</div><div class='noteText'>The prospect of being lonely and wrong can be unbearable .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 97 &middot; Location 1178</div><div class='noteText'>Third is complacency . Social elites have the most freedom and ability to explore new thinking , but they seem to believe in secrets the least .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 97 &middot; Location 1184</div><div class='noteText'>if it were possible to discover something new , wouldn’t someone from the faceless global talent pool of smarter and more creative people have found it already ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 97 &middot; Location 1190</div><div class='noteText'>We can be glad that there are fewer crazy cults now , yet that gain has come at great cost : we have given up our sense of wonder at secrets left to be discovered .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 98 &middot; Location 1194</div><div class='noteText'>For example , a world without secrets would enjoy a perfect understanding of justice . Every injustice necessarily involves a moral truth that very few people recognize early on : in a democratic society , a wrongful practice persists only when most people don’t perceive it to be unjust . At first , only a small minority of abolitionists knew that slavery was evil ; that view has rightly become conventional , but it was still a secret in the early 19th century . To say that there are no secrets left today would mean that we live in a society with no hidden injustices .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 100 &middot; Location 1226</div><div class='noteText'>You can’t find secrets without looking for them .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 100 &middot; Location 1234</div><div class='noteText'>If you think something hard is impossible , you’ll never even start trying to achieve it . Belief in secrets is an effective truth .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 101 &middot; Location 1241</div><div class='noteText'>But we will never learn any of these secrets unless we demand to know them and force ourselves to look . The</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 102 &middot; Location 1264</div><div class='noteText'>competition and capitalism are opposites .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 102 &middot; Location 1267</div><div class='noteText'>You would notice that monopolists downplay their monopoly status to avoid scrutiny , while competitive firms strategically exaggerate their uniqueness . The differences between firms only seem small on the surface ; in fact , they are enormous .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 104 &middot; Location 1287</div><div class='noteText'>The best entrepreneurs know this : every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside . A great company is a conspiracy to change the world ; when you share your secret , the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>9. Foundations</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 105 &middot; Location 1304</div><div class='noteText'>Beginnings are special . They are qualitatively different from all that comes afterward . This was true 13.8 billion years ago , at the founding of our cosmos : in the earliest microseconds of its existence , the universe expanded by a factor of 1030 — a million trillion trillion .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 106 &middot; Location 1316</div><div class='noteText'>As a founder , your first job is to get the first things right , because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 108 &middot; Location 1351</div><div class='noteText'>To see misalignment at its most extreme , just visit the DMV . Suppose you need a new driver’s license .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 108 &middot; Location 1352</div><div class='noteText'>we live in a democratic republic .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 109 &middot; Location 1354</div><div class='noteText'>Of course , it doesn’t work like that .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 111 &middot; Location 1383</div><div class='noteText'>Even working remotely should be avoided , because misalignment can creep in whenever colleagues aren’t together full - time , in the same place , every day .

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>10. The Mechanics of Mafia</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 116 &middot; Location 1456</div><div class='noteText'>Why work with a group of people who don’t even like each other ? Many seem to think it’s a sacrifice necessary for making money . But taking a merely professional view of the workplace , in which free agents check in and out on a transactional basis , is worse than cold : it’s not even rational . Since time is your most valuable asset , it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision any long - term future together . If you can’t count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work , you haven’t invested your time well — even in purely financial terms .</h3>
